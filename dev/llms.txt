# rules

## Introduction

rules is a [parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/) extension package
with model definitions for rule-based models, including:

- cubist models that have discrete rule sets that contain linear models
  with an ensemble method similar to boosting
- classification rules where a ruleset is derived from an initial tree
  fit
- *rule-fit* models that begin with rules extracted from a tree ensemble
  which are then added to a regularized linear or logistic regression.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rules from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rules")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidymodels/rules")
```

## Available Engines

The rules package provides engines for the models in the following
table.

| model        | engine | mode           |
|:-------------|:-------|:---------------|
| C5_rules     | C5.0   | classification |
| cubist_rules | Cubist | regression     |
| rule_fit     | xrf    | classification |
| rule_fit     | xrf    | regression     |
