The outputs for these tidy functions are different since the model structures are different. 

Let's look at Cubist and RuleFit first, using the Ames data, then C5.0 with a different data set.

## An example using the Ames data

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(rules)
library(rlang)
tidymodels_prefer()
options(pillar.advice = FALSE, pillar.min_title_chars = Inf)
```

First we will fit a Cubist model and tidy it:

```{r, warnings = FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(rules)
library(rlang)

data(ames, package = "modeldata")

ames <- ames |> 
  mutate(Sale_Price = log10(Sale_Price)) |> 
  select(Sale_Price, Longitude, Latitude, Central_Air)

cb_fit <-
  cubist_rules(committees = 10) |>
  set_engine("Cubist") |>
  fit(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames)

cb_res <- tidy(cb_fit)

cb_res
```

Since Cubist fits linear regressions within the data from each rule, the coefficients are in the `estimate` column and other information are in `statistic`: 

```{r}
cb_res$estimate[[1]]
cb_res$statistic[[1]]
```

Note that we can get the data for this rule by using [rlang::parse_expr()] with it:

```{r}
rule_1_expr <- parse_expr(cb_res$rule[1])
rule_1_expr
```

then use it to get the data back:

```{r}
filter(ames, !!rule_1_expr)
```

Now let's fit a RuleFit model. First, we'll use a recipe to convert the Central Air predictor to an indicator: 

```{r}
xrf_reg_mod <-
  rule_fit(trees = 3, penalty = .001) |>
  set_engine("xrf") |>
  set_mode("regression")
# Make dummy variables since xgboost will not

ames_rec <-
  recipe(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames) |>
  step_dummy(Central_Air) |>
  step_zv(all_predictors())

ames_processed <- prep(ames_rec) |> bake(new_data = NULL)

xrf_reg_fit <-
  xrf_reg_mod |>
  fit(Sale_Price ~ ., data = ames_processed)

xrf_rule_res <- tidy(xrf_reg_fit, penalty = .001)

xrf_rule_res
```

Here, the focus is on the model coefficients produced by `glmnet`. We can also break down the results and sort them by the original predictor columns: 

```{r}
tidy(xrf_reg_fit, penalty = .001, unit = "columns")
```

## C5.0 classification models

Here, we'll use the Palmer penguin data: 

```{r}
data(penguins, package = "modeldata")

penguins <- drop_na(penguins)
```

First, let's fit a boosted rule-based model and tidy:

```{r}
rule_model <- 
  C5_rules(trees = 3) |> 
  fit(island ~ ., data = penguins)

rule_info <- tidy(rule_model)

rule_info

# The statistic column has the pre-computed data about the 
# data covered by the rule:
rule_info$statistic[[1]]
```

Tree-based models can also be tidied. Rather than saving the results in a recursive tree structure, we can show the paths to each of the terminal nodes (which is just a rule). 

Let's fit a model and tidy: 

```{r}
tree_model <- 
  boost_tree(trees = 3) |> 
  set_engine("C5.0") |> 
  set_mode("classification") |> 
  fit(island ~ ., data = penguins)

tree_info <- tidy(tree_model)

tree_info

# The statistic column has the class breakdown:
tree_info$statistic[[1]]
```

Note that C5.0 models can have fractional estimates of counts in the terminal nodes.
